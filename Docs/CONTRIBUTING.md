## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, have a question, or want to propose an enhancement, please follow these steps:

1. **Check existing issues**: Before opening a new issue, search the existing issues to see if someone has already reported it.
   
2. **Create a new issue**: If your issue hasn't been reported yet, feel free to open a new issue. Provide a clear and descriptive title and fill in the issue template with all relevant details. The more information you provide, the easier it will be for us to resolve the issue.

### Submitting Pull Requests

We welcome contributions in the form of pull requests (PRs). To submit a PR:

1. **Fork the repository**: If you haven't already, fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a new branch**: Always create a new branch for your changes. It's best practice to keep your branches focused on a single feature or bug fix.

3. **Make your changes**: Edit the code, documentation, or files that are necessary for the change you're making. Follow the style guidelines outlined below.

4. **Test your changes**: If applicable, ensure that you've written tests and that they pass. If this is a bug fix, be sure to include a test to prevent future regressions.

5. **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message that describes what youâ€™ve done. Refer to the issue number if applicable (e.g., `Fixes #42`).

6. **Submit the pull request**: Open a PR from your branch to the main repository. Be sure to provide a description of the changes, and link to the issue it addresses if relevant.

We will review your PR and provide feedback. If everything looks good, we'll merge your changes.

## Style Guidelines

- **Documentation**: Ensure all code changes are documented clearly, especially if they introduce new functionality or APIs. Update any relevant documentation, including `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and inline code comments.

- **Naming conventions**: Choose meaningful, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Follow the naming conventions commonly used in the project.

- **Tests**: We encourage you to add tests that cover your changes, especially for new features and bug fixes. We use [Testing Framework] for unit and integration tests (replace with your framework).
