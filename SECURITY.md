## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously and encourage responsible reporting of vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please follow the steps below to ensure it is handled in a timely and responsible manner:

### Steps for Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Do not create a public issue**: Please do not open a GitHub issue or post a public comment about the vulnerability in the repository. Publicly disclosing a vulnerability before it has been resolved can lead to exploitation and may harm users.
   
2. **Contact us directly**: 
   - Send an email to our security team at: [pheonix.community.mail@gmail.com](mailto:pheonix.community.mail@gmail.com)
   
3. **Provide details**: Include as much detail as possible to help us understand the vulnerability. This may include:
   - A description of the vulnerability and how it can be reproduced
   - Any potential impacts or risks
   - The version of the software or environment where the issue was found
   - Any other relevant information (e.g., logs, screenshots, or proof of concept)

4. **We will acknowledge your report**: After receiving your report, we will acknowledge it and start investigating the issue. We will work with you to resolve it and provide updates as appropriate.

5. **Responsible Disclosure**: Once a fix has been implemented, we will release a patch and document the issue (without disclosing sensitive details). A public announcement will be made to ensure users can protect themselves. We aim to resolve security issues as quickly as possible and will provide updates when necessary.
